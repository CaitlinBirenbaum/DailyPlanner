# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

We were tasked with creating a calender application that saves events and indicates time by changing CSS classes. The site interacts with Moment.js in order to retrieve and accurate date and time. The current date and time is displayed at the top of the calendar, with hours 9am-5pm running along the left side of the page in a column. Each timeblock is color coded based on past, present, or future classes. Past is coded as grey, present is red, and future is green. Each timeblock contains a text area for writing events. The events are saved in local storage after pressing the save button. Appliacation is deployed at live URL using github pages, (https://caitlinbirenbaum.github.io/DailyPlanner/), and follows all best practices for naming conventions.
